# A TEAM HAS NO NAME Lab 2

## README for Luke Hudspeth and Juliette Pouchol

### Project Description
This application is a user entry log-in page, with the 
functionality mandated on the CS65 course website. Lab 2 built upon lab1 and 
implemented the use of server interactions with the creating of accounts. 

### Authors:
Luke Hudspeth '19 and Juliette Pouchol '20

### Testing
For our testing plan, we underwent very extensive unit testing, ensuring that
every feature we implemented met the specifications on the course website. 
We tested our App both on Andoird emulators and on an external Android Nexus 6P.

### Contribution:
See commit history. Equal contribution on both of our parts.
